# Weather App

A simple weather app that displays the current weather conditions based on the user's location or a city they search for. The app uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather data and displays it with corresponding icons.

## Features

- Automatically detects the user's current location and displays weather information (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
- Allows users to search for weather information by city name.
- Displays weather condition icons (sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.) based on the API data.
- Responsive design and easy to use.

## Technologies Used
